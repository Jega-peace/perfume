       <h1>About Us</h1>
       <p>The art of perfume making dates back centuries – to the ancient Romans, Persians, Arabs, Orientals and Indians. Tapputi, a perfume maker from Mesopotamia, is known to be the first recorded perfume maker dating back to 1200 BC. A chemist, she developed the first nascent methods for extracting perfumes and documented these groundbreaking techniques on cuneiform tablets. India is also no stranger to perfume making. Ancient Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita go into detail on the distillation process of ‘ittar’ or perfume. However, the oldest perfumery dates back to Cyprus, where archaeologists conducted an excavation that revealed a massive perfume factory of 4,000 sq metres, that existed four millennia ago, during the Bronze age! Islamic countries have also contributed to modern perfume making processes from the 6th century onwards, since being traders, they had access to global ingredients to use. So you have the Arabs and Persians to thank for initiating scents like musk, roses, jasmine, amber, spices, herbs, citrus fruits and woody scents. The concept of perfumes came to Europe only in the fourteenth century courtesy traders from Arabia, and the Hungarians were the first to use scented oils in an alcohol solution, and initiate the first of the modern perfume making process, as we know it today. </p>
